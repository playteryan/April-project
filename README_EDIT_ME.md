# PLAYTE APR1 Starter (No-code friendly)

This is a starter kit for a "normal-looking company website" that slowly becomes suspicious,
then reveals a playful Portal + Leak Archive (escape-room style).

## What you edit (90% of the work)
- Replace text placeholders like [[CLUE_1]] , [[PUZZLE_1]] , [[INSTAGRAM_URL]]
- Replace images inside `assets/img/`
- Change the access key in `assets/js/unlock.js` (ACCESS_KEY)

## Easiest image workflow
1) Put your image in `assets/img/`
2) Keep the same file name used in the page (or update the `src` in HTML)

## GitHub Pages
- Ensure `index.html` is at the repo root.
- Enable Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch (main / root).

## Safety
This is NOT real security. Do not store real secrets.
